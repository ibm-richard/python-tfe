"""
Comprehensive Integration Test for python-tfe Projects CRUD Operations

This file tests all CRUD operations:
- List: Get all projects in an organization
- Create: Add new projects with validation
- Read: Get specific project details
- Update: Modify existing projects
- Delete: Remove projects

Setup Instructions:
1. Create a test organization in HCP Terraform (https://app.terraform.io)
2. Generate an organization or user API token with appropriate permissions
3. Set environment variables:
   export TFE_TOKEN="your-api-token-here"
   export TFE_ORG="your-test-organization-name"
4. Run the tests:
   pytest examples/project.py -v -s

Important Notes:
- These tests make real API calls and create/delete actual resources
- Always use a dedicated test organization, never production
- Tests will fail if you don't have proper permissions
- Clean up is automatic, but verify resources are deleted after testing
